                    <p>Greetings there! I go by Navisha Sookoo, affectionately known as "Vish" â€“ just like "fish," but with a playful twist.</p>
                    <p>Ironically, Marine Biology has always intrigued me, and I'm no stranger to the allure of the waters; swimming is a passion of mine.</p>
                    <p>I have a knack for visualizing the seemingly impossible. Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Richfield Graduate Institute of Technology, with a focus on Software Development, I'm journeying towards my degree. </p>
                    <p>My fascination with video games sparked my interest in Information Technology, driving me to unravel the intricacies behind seamless gameplay execution. While I'm taking strides as a web developer now, my sights are set on specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics down the road.</p>
